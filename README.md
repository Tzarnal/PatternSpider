Patern Spider
=============
PaternSpider is a Irc Bot written in C#. It uses http://github.com/meebey/SmartIrc4net as its IRC Library. PatterSpider is plugin based, plugins are .dll files loaded through ComponentModel.

PatternSpider began life as an Exalted dice bot and still remains primariy a dicebot today. As such most of its plugins are for throwing dice. At the moment it suports simple generic dice expressions that can include math. Additionally it has system specific plugins for Exalted, NWoD and Fudge. 

If you want to see support for other specific systems please feel free to create a Issue for it.

PatternSpider can also be used as a Chatterbot, the "Sentience" plugin uses http://github.com/Xesyto/RelayChains a very simple Markov Chain chatbot implementation in C#.
